# SCT_ML_2 - Machine Learning Task 2

## 📘 Task Overview
This task demonstrates **Customer Segmentation** using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. We applied unsupervised learning techniques to group customers based on their annual income and spending scores.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📂 Files Included
- `Task2.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook implementing customer segmentation using KMeans.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivanii2003/SCT_ML_2.git
   cd SCT_ML_2
   ```
2. Open `Task2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to generate cluster labels and visualize customer groups.

## 📊 Key Features
- Synthetic dataset creation
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- K-Means clustering on income and spending score
- Cluster visualization with centroids

## 💡 What I Learned
- How K-Means clustering works
- Importance of feature scaling
- Visual interpretation of clusters
- Real-world use of unsupervised learning for segmentation

## 📈 Sample Output
A scatter plot showing 3 customer segments with distinct colors and highlighted centroids.
